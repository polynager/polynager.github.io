        <h1>11.1 What Does Equilibrium Mean in an Oligopoly?</h1>

    <p>Equilibrium in an oligopoly is more complex than in perfect competition or monopoly because firms’ actions influence each other. Here’s the core idea:</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>In Simple Markets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Equilibrium occurs where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.</li>
            <li>No participant wants to change their decision. Example: in a farmer’s market, apple prices adjust to avoid surplus or shortage.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>In Oligopolies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Firms must consider competitors’ reactions. Example: if one airline lowers prices, others may follow.</li>
            <li>Equilibrium occurs when each firm chooses its best price or quantity given the strategies of others.</li>
            <li>No firm can increase profits by changing strategy unilaterally.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Key Point</h3>
        <p>Oligopoly equilibrium includes both market-clearing (supply = demand) and stability among firms’ strategies. This is known as <em>Nash equilibrium</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
        <p>Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu set subscription prices based on competitors. If both settle on prices where neither gains by changing, the market is in equilibrium.</p>

    <h1>11.2 Oligopoly with Identical Goods: Collusion and Cartels</h1>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Key Points</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collusion</strong>: Firms agree to act like a monopoly by coordinating production and pricing, sharing monopoly profits.</li>
            <li><strong>Cartel</strong>: An organization formed to facilitate collusion among firms.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Why Collusion is Unstable</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Market Setup:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inverse demand: <code>P = 20 - Q</code></li>
                    <li>Marginal cost (MC): $4</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collusive Equilibrium:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total output: <code>Q = 8</code></li>
                    <li>Price: <code>P = 12</code></li>
                    <li>Industry profit: <span class="formula">(12 - 4) × 8 = 64</span> dollars</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheating Incentive:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Firm A produces 1 more unit:</li>
                    <li>Total output: <code>Q = 9</code>, lowering price to <code>P = 11</code></li>
                    <li>Firm A’s profit: <span class="formula">(11 - 4) × 5 = 35</span> dollars</li>
                    <li>This profit incentive makes collusion unstable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Visual Explanation</h3>
        <p>The plot below shows the demand curve, marginal revenue curve, and marginal cost:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collusion:</strong> At <code>Q = 8</code>, firms collectively maximize profits (<code>P = 12</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Cheating:</strong> A single firm increases output to <code>Q = 9</code>, reducing the price to <code>P = 11</code> and gaining a higher profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Collusion is unstable because the incentive to cheat disrupts the agreement.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Collusion Easier?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Detecting and Punishing Cheaters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cartels need a way to monitor members and enforce penalties for cheating.</li>
                <li>Example: In <strong>OPEC</strong>, countries agree on oil production quotas. If one country exceeds its quota, others may retaliate by increasing production, lowering prices, and reducing the cheater's profits.</li>
                <li>This enforcement discourages cheating and stabilizes the cartel.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Similar Marginal Costs:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When members have similar production costs, agreeing on output levels and prices is easier.</li>
                <li>Example: A hypothetical dairy farmers' cartel can set a common price per gallon if all farmers have similar milk production costs.</li>
                <li>Differing costs can lead to disagreements and potential breakdowns.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>
            <strong>Long-Term Perspective:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cartels are more stable if members focus on long-term gains rather than short-term profits.</li>
                <li>Example: Airlines could maintain higher ticket prices by valuing future profits over immediate market share, avoiding price wars that destabilize collusion.</li>

    <h2>11.3 Bertrand Competition with Identical Goods</h2>

    <h3>Introduction to Bertrand Competition</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Firms sell identical products.</li>
                <li>Consumers buy from the firm offering the lowest price.</li>
                <li>If prices are equal, demand is split evenly between firms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nash Equilibrium:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Each firm charges a price equal to its marginal cost.</li>
                <li>Neither firm can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its price.</li>
                <li>Firms earn zero economic profit in equilibrium.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: Walmart vs. Target</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Setup:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Two stores sell Nintendo Switch consoles with identical marginal costs of $300.</li>
                <li>Consumers are indifferent between stores aside from price.</li>
                <li>Demand rule: Buy from the store with the lowest price; split demand evenly if prices are equal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Incentive to Undercut:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If Walmart charges $175, Target can undercut with $174.99 and capture the entire market.</li>
                <li>This triggers continuous undercutting until prices reach marginal cost ($300).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Both firms charge a price equal to marginal cost ($300).</li>
                <li>Each firm earns zero economic profit and captures half the market.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Insights from Bertrand Competition</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Even a small number of firms can create intense competition.</li>
        <li>Outcome is equivalent to perfect competition: Price = Marginal Cost.</li>
        <li>Examples include online shopping platforms where consumers compare identical products easily.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Coordination Fails</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Firms would benefit from charging prices above marginal cost, but collusion is unstable.</li>
        <li>The incentive to slightly lower price undermines cooperative pricing strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Generalization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Results hold with more than two firms: Each has a strong incentive to undercut competitors.</li>
        <li>Equilibrium price remains at marginal cost, with firms splitting the market evenly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11.4 Oligopoly with Identical Goods: Cournot Competition</h2>

    <h3>Model Assumptions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firms sell identical goods.</li>
        <li>Firms compete by choosing production quantities.</li>
        <li>Market price is determined by total output from all firms.</li>
        <li>Firms choose quantities simultaneously.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example: Crude Oil Industry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Setup:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Two producers: Saudi Arabia and Iran.</li>
                <li>Marginal cost (MC): $20 per barrel.</li>
                <li>Inverse demand curve: P = 200 - 3Q, where Q = q_S + q_I.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Saudi Arabia’s marginal revenue: MR_S = 200 - 6q_S - 3q_I.</li>
                <li>Optimal production: 200 - 6q_S - 3q_I = 20 → q_S = 30 - 0.5q_I.</li>
                <li>Iran’s reaction curve: q_I = 30 - 0.5q_S.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cournot Equilibrium:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Solve reaction curves: q_S = 30 - 0.5(30 - 0.5q_S) → q_S = 20.</li>
                <li>Substitute into Iran’s curve: q_I = 30 - 0.5(20) = 20.</li>
                <li>Total output: Q = 40.</li>
                <li>Price: P = 200 - 3(40) = 80 dollars per barrel.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Profits:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Each country earns 20 × (80 - 20) = 1,200 million dollars per day.</li>
                <li>Total industry profit: 2.4 billion dollars per day.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reaction Curves:</strong> Show how each firm adjusts production based on the other’s output.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Interaction:</strong> Each firm’s decision affects the other’s residual demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Nash Equilibrium:</strong> At q_S = 20, q_I = 20, neither firm can improve profit by changing output.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Outcome:</strong> Price = 80 dollars per barrel. Competition is less intense than Bertrand but more competitive than monopoly.</li>

    <h2>11.5 Oligopoly with Identical Goods but with a First-Mover: Stackelberg Competition</h2>

    <h3>Model Assumptions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firms sell identical goods.</li>
        <li>Firms compete by choosing quantities.</li>
        <li>Market price is determined by total production.</li>
        <li>One firm (leader) chooses its quantity first, and the follower reacts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example: Saudi Arabia as the Stackelberg Leader</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Setup:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Inverse demand: P = 200 - 3Q, where Q = q_S + q_I.</li>
                <li>Marginal cost (MC): 20 dollars per barrel.</li>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Saudi Arabia’s Decision:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Substitute Iran’s reaction curve: q_I = 30 - 0.5q_S.</li>
                <li>Adjusted demand: P = 110 - 1.5q_S.</li>
                <li>Marginal revenue: MR_S = 110 - 3q_S.</li>
                <li>Profit maximization: 110 - 3q_S = 20 → q_S = 30.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Iran’s Response:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Substitute q_S = 30 into reaction curve: q_I = 30 - 0.5(30) = 15.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Market Outcomes:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Total output: Q = 30 + 15 = 45.</li>
                <li>Price: P = 200 - 3(45) = 65 dollars per barrel.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Profits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Saudi Arabia: 30 × (65 - 20) = 1,350 million dollars/day.</li>
        <li>Iran: 15 × (65 - 20) = 675 million dollars/day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First-Mover Advantage:</strong> Saudi Arabia increases output to 30 million barrels/day, forcing Iran to reduce output to 15. Saudi Arabia earns higher profits by moving first.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Price and Profit:</strong> Price drops to 65 dollars/barrel (lower than Cournot price of 80 dollars). Saudi Arabia benefits, while Iran earns less than in Cournot equilibrium.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Implications:</strong> The leader uses its position to dictate market conditions, leaving competitors with fewer profitable options.</li>

    <h2>11.6 Oligopoly with Differentiated Goods: Bertrand Competition</h2>

    <h3>Model Assumptions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firms sell similar but not identical goods, so consumers do not view them as perfect substitutes.</li>
        <li>Firms compete by setting prices.</li>
        <li>Firms set prices simultaneously.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Differentiated products give firms market power, so price competition is less intense than in the identical-products Bertrand model.</li>
        <li>Consumers substitute between products imperfectly, limiting extreme undercutting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: Burton vs. K2 (Snowboards)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Demand Curves:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Burton: q_B = 900 - 2p_B + p_K</li>
                <li>K2: q_K = 900 - 2p_K + p_B</li>
                <li>Demand decreases when a firm raises its price and increases when the competitor raises theirs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Revenue and Marginal Revenue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Burton’s total revenue: TR_B = p_B × (900 - 2p_B + p_K)</li>
                <li>Marginal revenue: MR_B = 900 - 4p_B + p_K</li>
                <li>K2’s marginal revenue is derived similarly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reaction Curves:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Burton: p_B = 225 + 0.25p_K</li>
                <li>K2: p_K = 225 + 0.25p_B</li>
                <li>Reaction curves are upward-sloping: higher competitor prices lead to higher optimal prices, unlike downward-sloping Cournot curves.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differentiated Bertrand Equilibrium</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nash Equilibrium:</strong> Occurs where reaction curves intersect:
            <ul>
                <li>Price: $300 per snowboard</li>
                <li>Quantity: 600 snowboards per firm</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Neither firm can increase profit by unilaterally changing its price.</li>
        <li>Differentiation reduces price competition, allowing positive economic profits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Graphical Interpretation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reaction curves show how each firm adjusts its price in response to the competitor.</li>
        <li>Upward-sloping curves illustrate mutual responsiveness: higher competitor prices lead to higher optimal prices.</li>
        <li>The Nash equilibrium is at the intersection of the curves, representing mutually optimal pricing strategies.</li>

    <h3>Model Assumptions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firms sell differentiated products that consumers do not view as perfect substitutes.</li>
        <li>Firms' residual demand curves are affected by competitors, but strategic interactions are ignored.</li>
        <li>There is free entry into the market.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Dynamics:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Firms face downward-sloping demand curves, giving them market power.</li>
                <li>Positive economic profit attracts new entrants, shifting demand for existing firms.</li>
                <li>Entry continues until profits are zero, where price equals average total cost (ATC).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite market power, firms earn zero economic profit in the long run.</li>
                <li>Differentiation ensures unique demand curves, unlike perfect competition.</li>

        <li>Many fast-food restaurants in a city: slightly different menus compete for the same customers. Entry continues until no firm earns excess profit.</li>

    <h3>Differences from Oligopoly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entry Barriers:</strong> Monopolistic competition has free entry, unlike oligopoly.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Interaction:</strong> Oligopolies consider competitors' actions, while monopolistically competitive firms assume competitors’ effects are negligible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plot 1: Monopoly (Single Firm)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A single fast-food restaurant faces demand curve DONE.</li>
        <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Quantity: Q*ONE = 8, where MRONE = MC.</li>
                <li>Price: P*ONE from the demand curve.</li>
                <li>Profit: Shaded area between price, ATC, and quantity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Key Insights:</strong> ATC includes fixed costs (U-shaped); profit exists because P > ATC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plot 2: Two Firms in the Market</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A second restaurant opens with a slightly different product.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial demand DONE shifts left and flattens to DTWO.</li>
                <li>Marginal revenue shifts MRONE → MRTWO.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> Each firm produces Q*TWO = 6 at price P*TWO; profits shrink but remain positive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plot 3: Long-Run Equilibrium with N Firms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Entry continues until no firm earns economic profit.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Demand DN flattens and shifts left.</li>
                <li>Marginal revenue becomes MRN.</li>
                <li>Quantity: Q*N = 4 at price P*N = ATC*.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> Zero profit; entry stops once firms just cover costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Monopoly:</strong> Single firm maximizes profit with steep demand curve and market power.</li>
        <li><strong>Short Run (Two Firms):</strong> Entry reduces demand for existing firms, lowering price and profits.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Run (N Firms):</strong> Free entry leads to zero economic profit as demand adjusts to ATC.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monopoly:</strong> A single neighborhood diner with no nearby competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Two Firms:</strong> Competing fast-food chains in the same area, slightly differentiated menus.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Run Equilibrium:</strong> Multiple car washes in a city, each just covering costs due to competition.</li>
    </ul>
