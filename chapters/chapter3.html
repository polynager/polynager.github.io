<h1>Using Supply and Demand to Analyze Markets</h1>
<section class="chapter-section">
  <h2>Market Equilibrium and Surplus</h2>
  <p>
    In microeconomics, we often use supply and demand curves to analyze market behavior. 
    These curves help us visualize how much consumers are willing to buy at different prices 
    (<strong>demand curve</strong>) and how much producers are willing to sell 
    (<strong>supply curve</strong>).
  </p>

  <h3>Demand Function</h3>
  <p>
    The demand function is:
    $$ P_D = 20 - 2Q $$
    where \( P_D \) is the price consumers are willing to pay and \( Q \) is the quantity demanded.
  </p>

  <h3>Supply Function</h3>
  <p>
    The supply function is:
    $$ P_S = 2 + Q $$
    where \( P_S \) is the price producers are willing to accept and \( Q \) is the quantity supplied.
  </p>

  <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
  <p>
    At equilibrium, quantity demanded equals quantity supplied:
    $$ 20 - 2Q = 2 + Q $$
    Solving gives:
    $$ Q^* = 6, \quad P^* = 8 $$
  </p>

  <h3>Consumer Surplus</h3>
  <p>
    Consumer surplus is the area above equilibrium price and below the demand curve:
    $$
    \text{CS} = \tfrac{1}{2} \times Q^* \times (P_{\text{max}} - P^*) 
    = \tfrac{1}{2} \times 6 \times (20 - 8) = 36
    $$
  </p>

  <h3>Producer Surplus</h3>
  <p>
    Producer surplus is the area below equilibrium price and above the supply curve:
    $$
    \text{PS} = \tfrac{1}{2} \times Q^* \times (P^* - P_{\text{min}}) 
    = \tfrac{1}{2} \times 6 \times (8 - 2) = 18
    $$
  </p>

  <h3>Shifts and Welfare</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A leftward shift in <strong>supply</strong> (e.g., higher costs) reduces producer surplus.</li>
    <li>A rightward shift in <strong>demand</strong> (e.g., stronger preferences) increases both surpluses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Economic Meaning of Changes in Consumer and Producer Surplus</h2>
  <p>
    In economics, <strong>consumer surplus</strong> and <strong>producer surplus</strong> 
    measure welfare. They represent the gains consumers and producers receive from 
    participating in the market. Changes in these surpluses signal shifts in market welfare.
  </p>

  <h3>Consumer Surplus</h3>
  <p>
    Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to 
    pay and the actual price they pay. A change in consumer surplus typically reflects 
    shifts in demand or supply.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Increase in Consumer Surplus:</strong> A rightward demand shift 
      (e.g., stronger preferences) increases equilibrium quantity and price.  
      $$ \text{Demand shift right → higher Q, higher P → ↑ Consumer Surplus} $$
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decrease in Consumer Surplus:</strong> A leftward supply shift 
      (e.g., higher costs) reduces quantity and raises price.  
      $$ \text{Supply shift left → lower Q, higher P → ↓ Consumer Surplus} $$
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Producer Surplus</h3>
  <p>
    Producer surplus is the difference between the price producers receive and the minimum 
    they are willing to accept.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Increase in Producer Surplus:</strong> A rightward demand shift 
      boosts both equilibrium price and quantity.  
      $$ \text{Demand shift right → higher Q, higher P → ↑ Producer Surplus} $$
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decrease in Producer Surplus:</strong> A leftward supply shift 
      raises costs, reduces sales, and lowers profitability.  
      $$ \text{Supply shift left → lower Q, higher P → ↓ Producer Surplus} $$
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Surplus Changes Matter</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Government Policies:</strong>  
      - A price ceiling (e.g., rent control) reduces producer surplus.  
      - A price floor (e.g., minimum wage) reduces consumer surplus.  
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Market Interventions:</strong>  
      - A tax reduces both consumer and producer surplus and creates deadweight loss.  
      - A subsidy increases both surpluses by lowering prices for consumers and raising 
        effective prices for producers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Example from Lecture Notes</h3>
  <p>
    When supply shifts left due to higher costs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consumer Surplus:</strong> Higher price + smaller quantity → ↓ surplus.</li>
    <li><strong>Producer Surplus:</strong> Higher costs + fewer sales → ↓ surplus.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Understanding Price Ceilings</h2>

  <p>
    A <strong>price ceiling</strong> is a government-imposed limit on how high a price can be charged 
    for a product. Price ceilings are typically imposed to protect consumers from excessively high 
    prices in markets where supply is limited. When a price ceiling is set below the natural 
    equilibrium price, it creates several effects on the market.
  </p>

  <h3>Effects of a Price Ceiling</h3>
  <p>
    When the government imposes a price ceiling below the equilibrium price ($P^*$), the following occurs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Quantity demanded</strong> increases because consumers are willing to purchase more at a lower price.</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity supplied</strong> decreases because producers are less willing to supply the good at the lower price.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As a result, a <strong>shortage</strong> occurs, where the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied.
  </p>

  <h3>Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus</h3>
  <p>
    In the absence of a price ceiling, the <strong>consumer surplus</strong> and <strong>producer surplus</strong> 
    are maximized. 
  </p>
  <p>
    - <strong>Consumer surplus</strong>: area between the demand curve and the price consumers pay. <br>
    - <strong>Producer surplus</strong>: area between the supply curve and the price producers receive.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a price ceiling is imposed below the equilibrium price:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>new consumer surplus</strong> includes a larger area above the ceiling price plus part of the original surplus.</li>
    <li>The <strong>new producer surplus</strong> is smaller, reflecting the lower price producers receive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Deadweight Loss</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Deadweight loss (DWL)</strong> represents the loss of total surplus due to the inefficiencies created by the price ceiling. 
    It is the area of potential trades that no longer occur due to the shortage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mathematically:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    \text{DWL} = \tfrac{1}{2} \times (Q^* - Q_{\text{ceiling}}) \times (P_{\text{demand}} - P_{\text{supply}})
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    where:
    <ul>
      <li>$Q_{\text{ceiling}}$ = quantity supplied at the ceiling price</li>
      <li>$P_{\text{demand}}$ = price consumers are willing to pay at $Q_{\text{ceiling}}$</li>
      <li>$P_{\text{supply}}$ = price producers are willing to accept at $Q_{\text{ceiling}}$</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    A price ceiling below equilibrium benefits some consumers who can still purchase at the lower price, 
    but it creates a <strong>shortage</strong> and reduces both consumer and producer surpluses. 
    The <strong>deadweight loss</strong> represents lost welfare due to inefficient allocation of resources.

  <h2>Understanding Quotas</h2>

  <p>
    A <strong>quota</strong> is a government-imposed limit on the quantity of a good that can be 
    produced or sold in the market. Quotas are typically used to control the supply of certain 
    goods, such as imports or agricultural products, to prevent overproduction or protect 
    domestic industries. When a quota is set below the natural equilibrium quantity, it restricts 
    the quantity that can be supplied, creating inefficiencies in the market.
  </p>

  <h3>Effects of a Quota</h3>
  <p>
    When the government imposes a quota below the equilibrium quantity ($Q^*$), the following occurs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Quantity supplied</strong> decreases because producers are restricted from selling beyond a certain amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Price</strong> increases due to the limited supply, as consumers are willing to pay more for the reduced quantity of the good.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As a result, a <strong>shortage</strong> occurs because the quota restricts supply below the market’s natural level. 
    This leads to higher prices and market inefficiencies.
  </p>

  <h3>Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus</h3>
  <p>
    In the absence of a quota, both <strong>consumer surplus</strong> and <strong>producer surplus</strong> 
    are maximized.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a quota is imposed below equilibrium:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>new consumer surplus</strong> is smaller because consumers face higher prices and a reduced quantity of goods.</li>
    <li>The <strong>new producer surplus</strong> is mixed: some producers may benefit from higher prices, but overall surplus falls due to restricted sales.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Deadweight Loss</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Deadweight loss (DWL)</strong> represents the loss of total surplus caused by the quota. 
    It reflects the value of potential trades that no longer occur because the quota prevents 
    the market from reaching its natural equilibrium.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mathematically:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    \text{DWL} = \tfrac{1}{2} \times (Q^* - Q_{\text{quota}}) \times (P_{\text{demand}} - P_{\text{supply}})
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$Q_{\text{quota}}$ = quantity allowed under the quota</li>
    <li>$P_{\text{demand}}$ = price consumers are willing to pay at $Q_{\text{quota}}$</li>
    <li>$P_{\text{supply}}$ = price producers are willing to accept at $Q_{\text{quota}}$</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    A quota below equilibrium reduces the amount of the good sold, leading to higher prices and 
    smaller consumer and producer surpluses. The <strong>deadweight loss</strong> represents the 
    inefficiency and lost welfare caused by the quota. While some producers may benefit from 
    higher prices, overall market efficiency declines.

  <h2>Understanding Tax Incidence with Different Elasticities of Demand</h2>

  <h3>Supply Function</h3>
  <p>
    In this analysis, we assume a linear supply function given by:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$ P = 2 + Q $$
  </p>
  <p>
    This function indicates that as the quantity supplied increases, the price also increases 
    linearly. While this supply function is not strictly unit elastic (which would require the 
    percentage change in quantity supplied to equal the percentage change in price), it provides 
    a simple linear relationship for examining tax incidence with different demand elasticities.
  </p>

  <h3>Demand Functions</h3>
  <p>We explore three different demand scenarios:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Perfectly Elastic Demand</strong>: The demand curve is horizontal at 
      $$ P = 5 $$. Consumers are highly sensitive to price changes, and they will only accept this price. 
      If the price rises, demand drops to zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Perfectly Inelastic Demand</strong>: The demand curve is vertical at 
      $$ Q = 4 $$. Consumers are completely insensitive to price changes and purchase the same quantity regardless of price.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Variable Elasticity</strong>: The demand curve is 
      $$ P = 5 - bQ $$, where $b$ is a variable slope parameter. A larger $b$ makes the curve steeper 
      (more inelastic), while a smaller $b$ makes it flatter (more elastic).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Tax Incidence and Elasticity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Perfectly Elastic Demand</strong>:  
      Producers cannot pass any tax onto consumers. The entire tax burden falls on producers (100% incidence on producers).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Perfectly Inelastic Demand</strong>:  
      Producers pass the entire tax onto consumers. The price consumers pay rises by the full amount of the tax 
      (100% incidence on consumers).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Variable Elasticity</strong>:  
      The tax burden is shared between consumers and producers.  
      <ul>
        <li>If demand is relatively inelastic (large $b$), consumers bear most of the burden.</li>
        <li>If demand is relatively elastic (small $b$), producers bear most of the burden.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The elasticity of demand is key to determining tax incidence.  
    <ul>
      <li>With perfectly elastic demand, the entire burden falls on producers.</li>
      <li>With perfectly inelastic demand, the entire burden falls on consumers.</li>
      <li>With variable elasticity, the burden is shared depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.</li>
    </ul>
    This framework explains why policymakers consider elasticity when predicting the real-world effects of taxation.

  <h2>Summary of Market Equilibrium, Surplus, Price Ceilings, Quotas, and Taxes</h2>

  <h3>1. Market Equilibrium</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Market Equilibrium</strong> occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, at the intersection of the supply and demand curves.</li>
    <li>The <strong>equilibrium price</strong> ensures no shortage or surplus, as buyers and sellers agree on the same quantity.</li>
    <li>In visualizations, the equilibrium is highlighted as the intersection point of the supply and demand curves.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Consumer and Producer Surplus</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consumer Surplus</strong>: The difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. Graphically, it’s the area above the price and below the demand curve up to equilibrium.</li>
    <li><strong>Producer Surplus</strong>: The difference between what producers are willing to accept and what they actually receive. Graphically, it’s the area below the price and above the supply curve up to equilibrium.</li>
    <li>Surpluses change with shifts in supply or demand, as shown in the interactive tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Price Ceilings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price Ceiling</strong>: A government-imposed maximum price, usually set below equilibrium to make goods more affordable.</li>
    <li>Below equilibrium, it causes <strong>shortages</strong>, as demand exceeds supply at the capped price.</li>
    <li>Creates <strong>Deadweight Loss (DWL)</strong>: the lost efficiency because equilibrium cannot be reached.</li>
    <li>Visualizations illustrated ceilings with sliders, highlighting consumer surplus, producer surplus, and DWL regions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Quotas</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Quota</strong>: A government-imposed restriction on quantity supplied, regardless of price.</li>
    <li>Quotas below equilibrium reduce traded quantity and often raise prices.</li>
    <li>Cause <strong>Deadweight Loss</strong> since fewer mutually beneficial trades occur.</li>
    <li>Visualizations represented quotas as vertical cutoffs, adjusting shaded areas for surpluses and DWL.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Taxes and Tax Incidence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Taxes</strong> shift the supply (upward) or demand (downward) curve depending on who is taxed.</li>
    <li>The new equilibrium features lower traded quantity, higher consumer prices, and lower net producer receipts.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Incidence</strong> (who bears the burden):</li>
    <ul>
      <li>With <em>perfectly elastic demand</em>, producers bear the full tax.</li>
      <li>With <em>perfectly inelastic demand</em>, consumers bear the full tax.</li>
      <li>With <em>variable elasticity</em>, the burden is shared depending on relative elasticities.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Visualizations used dashed lines and labels to show incidence splits and surplus shifts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Market tools—equilibrium, surpluses, ceilings, quotas, and taxes—demonstrate how prices and quantities adjust.  
    Government interventions often create <strong>deadweight loss</strong> and redistribute surpluses, showing the trade-offs of policy choices.  
    Interactive visualizations help reveal these dynamics clearly, making abstract economic principles more intuitive.
