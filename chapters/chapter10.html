<div class="text-box">
    <h1>10.1 The Basics of Pricing Strategy</h1>

    <p>A <strong>pricing strategy</strong> is a firm’s plan for setting the price of its product based on market conditions and its goal to maximize profit.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Perfectly Competitive Firm:</strong> Charges the market equilibrium price; cannot influence the price.</li>
        <li><strong>Firm with Market Power:</strong> Sets price where <code>MR = MC</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this chapter, we focus on <strong>price discrimination</strong>, where a firm charges different prices to different customers for the same product. This allows a firm with market power to earn greater economic profit than a single-price monopoly.</p>

    <h2>Key Requirements for Advanced Pricing Strategies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Market Power</strong> – The firm can set prices above marginal cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevention of Resale / Arbitrage</strong> – Customers cannot resell the product to others, preventing undercutting of higher prices.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When these conditions are satisfied, firms can employ strategies such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct and indirect price discrimination</li>
        <li>Bundling multiple products</li>
        <li>Two-part tariffs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Pricing Strategies</h2>

    <h3>1. Price Discrimination</h3>
    <p>Requires identifying customers with different <em>price sensitivities of demand</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Price Discrimination:</strong> The firm knows customer characteristics or demand:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-Degree (Perfect) Price Discrimination:</strong> Charges each customer their maximum willingness to pay.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Degree Price Discrimination (Segmentation):</strong> Charges different prices to distinct groups based on observable traits (e.g., age, location).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Indirect Price Discrimination:</strong> The firm cannot observe customers’ willingness to pay directly and relies on self-selection:
            <ul>
                <li>Quantity discounts</li>
                <li>Multiple product versions at varying prices</li>
                <li>Coupons</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Other Pricing Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Block Pricing:</strong> Different unit prices for different quantities purchased.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Part Tariffs:</strong> A lump-sum fee plus a per-unit price.</li>
        <li><strong>Bundling:</strong> Selling multiple products together as a package to increase total profit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Advanced pricing strategies, especially <strong>price discrimination</strong>, allow firms with market power to capture more surplus by tailoring prices to customer willingness to pay. The effectiveness depends on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The type and granularity of information the firm has about customers</li>
        <li>The ability to prevent resale or arbitrage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Strategies like <strong>bundling</strong> and <strong>two-part tariffs</strong> extend these principles to extract additional profit from both differentiated and uniform customer groups.</p>

    <h1>Why Segmenting the Market is Better for Producers</h1>

    <p>Segmenting the market allows producers to increase total producer surplus by charging different prices in different market segments based on consumers’ willingness to pay.</p>

    <h2>Original Surplus (Without Segmentation)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Producer sets a <strong>single price</strong> for both traveling and local participants.</li>
        <li>The combined demand curve is flatter due to the larger market, limiting producer surplus.</li>
        <li>Some potential surplus is lost because a single price cannot capture higher willingness to pay in one segment (e.g., traveling participants).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Surplus After Segmentation</h2>

    <h3>Traveling Market</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Price charged: <code>P<sub>T</sub> = 220</code></li>
        <li>Quantity: <code>Q = 600</code></li>
        <li>Producer surplus: <code>(220 - 100) × 600 = 72,000</code></li>
        <li>Surplus represented as the rectangle between <code>P = [100, 220]</code> and <code>Q = [0, 600]</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Market</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Price charged: <code>P<sub>L</sub> = 170</code></li>
        <li>Quantity: <code>Q = 700</code></li>
        <li>Producer surplus: <code>(170 - 100) × 700 = 49,000</code></li>
        <li>Surplus represented as the rectangle between <code>P = [100, 170]</code> and <code>Q = [0, 700]</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Total Producer Surplus After Segmentation</h2>
    <p><strong>Total Producer Surplus = 72,000 + 49,000 = 121,000</strong></p>

    <h2>Comparison</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Without segmentation, producer surplus is significantly lower due to a single pricing strategy.</li>
        <li>Segmentation allows charging higher prices to the traveling market and lower prices to the local market, maximizing total surplus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Segmenting the market increases producer surplus by matching prices to the willingness to pay of each market.</li>
        <li>This strategy captures more potential surplus and avoids the inefficiencies of uniform pricing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10.3 Direct Price Discrimination II: Segmenting (Third-Degree)</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>When to Use It:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firm has <strong>market power</strong> and can <strong>prevent resale</strong>.</li>
            <li>Customers have <strong>different demand curves</strong>.</li>
            <li>Firm can identify <strong>specific groups</strong> with different price sensitivities.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Concept:</strong> Divide customers into identifiable groups based on characteristics correlated with price sensitivity and charge different prices to each group. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Student discounts for school-branded clothing vs. higher prices for parents.
    </div>

    <h2>10.4 Indirect (Second-Degree) Price Discrimination</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>When to Use It:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firm has <strong>market power</strong> and can <strong>prevent resale</strong>.</li>
            <li>Cannot identify customers’ groups before purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Concept:</strong> Customers self-select pricing options based on willingness to pay. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Airlines offering refundable tickets for business travelers and non-refundable tickets for leisure travelers.
    </div>

    <h2>10.5 Bundling</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>When to Use It:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firm has <strong>market power</strong> and can <strong>prevent resale</strong>.</li>
            <li>Sells multiple products with <strong>negatively correlated demand</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Concept:</strong> Sell multiple products together at a single price to capture more producer surplus. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Streaming services bundling movies and sports packages.
    </div>

    <h2>10.6 Advanced Pricing Strategies</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>When to Use It:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firm has <strong>market power</strong> and can <strong>prevent resale</strong>.</li>
            <li>Customers may have either <strong>identical</strong> or <strong>different demand curves</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Block Pricing</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Reduce the price per unit as customers purchase larger quantities. Works even if customers have identical demand curves.</p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Single 12-ounce Pepsi can costs $1, six-pack costs $2.99, incentivizing larger purchases.

    <h3>Two-Part Tariffs</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Pricing has two components: a fixed fee plus a per-unit price.</p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Costco membership: $50 annual fee (fixed) + lower per-unit prices on goods.</li>
        <li>Video game consoles: console price (fixed fee) + individual game prices (per-unit).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Allows the firm to extract consumer surplus via the fixed fee while maintaining efficient consumption levels through the per-unit price.</p>
