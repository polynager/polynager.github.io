    <h1>Chapter 8.1: Market Structures and Perfect Competition in the Short Run</h1>

    <p>This chapter introduces <strong>four types of market structures</strong>: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Market structures are classified based on three main characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number of Firms:</strong> More firms typically increase competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Differentiation:</strong> Identical products lead to higher competition; differentiated products reduce it.</li>
        <li><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> Low barriers allow easier market entry, increasing competition; high barriers reduce it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Perfect Competition</h2>
    <p>A <strong>perfectly competitive market</strong> has the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number of Firms:</strong> Many firms exist, so no single firm can influence the market price.</li>
        <li><strong>Type of Product:</strong> Products are <strong>identical</strong>, making outputs perfect substitutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> None, allowing free entry and exit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
    <div class="key-point">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Price Takers:</strong> Firms can sell as much as they want at the market price but cannot influence it.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Efficiency:</strong> Perfect competition serves as a benchmark where goods are sold at <strong>marginal cost</strong>, and the sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized.</li>
            <li><strong>Firm Demand Curve:</strong> For an individual firm, the demand curve is <strong>perfectly elastic</strong>, represented as a horizontal line at the market price. This shows that the firm has <strong>no price-setting power</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>This model is rare in real-world markets but provides an important baseline for understanding efficiency and firm behavior in competitive environments.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 8.2: Profit Maximization in a Perfectly Competitive Market</h1>

    <p>In a perfectly competitive market, firms maximize profit by selecting the quantity of output where the <strong>marginal cost (MC)</strong> of production equals the market price (\(P\)), which is also their <strong>marginal revenue (MR)</strong>. Since perfectly competitive firms are <strong>price takers</strong>, they can only decide how much to produce, not the price at which they sell.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong> A firm maximizes profit by choosing output where \(MC = MR = P\). Producing beyond this point increases costs more than revenue, while producing less reduces potential revenue without lowering costs enough to increase profit.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Revenue and Total Cost:</strong> Profit is the difference between total revenue (\(TR = P \times Q\)) and total cost (\(TC\)).
            <ul>
                <li>The demand (MR) curve is a horizontal line at the market price.</li>
                <li>The total revenue curve is a straight line from the origin, as each unit of output adds the same revenue.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Profit Calculation:</strong> Profit at the optimal output \(Q^*\) can be calculated as:
            \[
            \text{Profit} = (P - ATC) \times Q^*
            \]
            where \(ATC\) is the average total cost at \(Q^*\).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Output Decisions with Price Changes:</strong> If market price changes, the firm adjusts output until \(MC = P\) again. Higher prices lead to higher output, lower prices lead to lower output.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Chapter 8.3: Perfect Competition in the Short Run</h1>

    <h2>Constructing the Short-Run Supply Curve for a Perfectly Competitive Industry</h2>
    <p>In a <strong>perfectly competitive market</strong>, each firm’s decision on output does not influence the overall market price individually. However, the <strong>combined output of all firms</strong> determines the <strong>industry supply curve</strong>. This aggregation is not a coordinated action by firms but reflects the <strong>sum of individual supply decisions</strong>. Firms base their output on their own costs and the market price, and summing these quantities across firms produces the total market supply.</p>

    <h3>The Industry Supply Curve as a Horizontal Sum of Firm-Level Supply Curves</h3>
    <p>To construct the industry supply curve:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Aggregate individual firm supply curves:</strong> For each price level, calculate the output each firm would supply, then sum these quantities across all firms.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of supply:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If the price is below a firm’s minimum average variable cost (AVC), the firm does not produce.</li>
                <li>If the price covers costs, the firm supplies a quantity determined by its marginal cost (MC), up to capacity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong> A market has 100 identical firms:
        <ul>
            <li>If \(P < 1\), no firm operates (price does not cover AVC).</li>
            <li>If \(1 \leq P < 2\), each firm supplies 1 unit → industry supply = \(100 \times 1 = 100\) units.</li>
            <li>If \(P \geq 2\), each firm supplies 2 units → industry supply = \(100 \times 2 = 200\) units.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Step-by-Step Explanation of the Market Dynamics</h1>

    <h2>Initial Market State</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Demand and Supply in the Long Run:</strong>
        \[ Q_{D1} = 30000 - 50P \]
        <p>Long-run supply price:</p>
        \[ P_{LR} = 250 \]
        <p>Industry quantity in initial equilibrium:</p>
        \[ Q_{initial} = Q_{D1}(P=250) = 30000 - 50 \cdot 250 = 17500 \]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firm-Level Details:</strong>
        \[ TC = 300Q - 10Q^2 + 0.5Q^3 \]
        \[ MC = 300 - 20Q + 1.5Q^2 \]
        \[ ATC = 300 - 10Q + 0.5Q^2 \]
        <p>Long-run firm output:</p>
        \[ Q_{firm} = 10 \]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Equilibrium Point:</strong>
        <p>At \(P = 250\), industry quantity = 17500, firm quantity = 10. This establishes the initial long-run equilibrium.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Effect of Demand Shift on Market Equilibrium</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Demand Shift:</strong>
        \[ Q_{D2} = (30000 + \text{demand shift}) - 50P \]
        <p>New quantity demanded at \(P = 250\):</p>
        \[ Q_{new} = Q_{D2}(P=250) \]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New Short-Run Equilibrium:</strong>
        <p>Price rises to meet increased demand. The new intersection of demand with short-run supply occurs at a higher price.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Firm-Level Adjustment in the Short Run</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>New Quantity per Firm:</strong>
        \[ Q_{firm}^{SR} = \frac{Q_{new}}{\text{initial number of firms}} \]
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Short-Run Production Price:</strong>
        \[ P_{new} = MC(Q_{firm}^{SR}) \]
        <p>This price and quantity mark the firm-level adjustment in the short run.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Short-Run Market Adjustment with Temporary Supply Curve</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Short-Run Supply Curve:</strong>
        <p>The slope of the short-run supply curve:</p>
        \[ m = \frac{P_2 - P_1}{Q_2 - Q_1} \]
        <p>Extended line shows the short-run supply curve.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Long-Run Return to Equilibrium</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Entry of New Firms:</strong>
        <p>Higher prices attract new firms, increasing industry supply and lowering the price back toward \(P_{LR} = 250\).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New Long-Run Quantity:</strong>
        <p>The market reaches a new long-run equilibrium with the same price but higher industry quantity.</p>
      </li>
